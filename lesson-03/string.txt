ways of creating strings
1. single quote
2. double quote , use double quote only when there is an single quote inside a string . For example I'm learning JS
3. back tick `` also called template strings

FEATURES OF TEMPLATE strings
1.interpolation = insert values betn strings , much cleaner for inserting values
2. multi line strings = use ` template strings always 



`Items( ${1+1} )` , prints Items (2)   

Escape character = \' ( creates a single quote)  \" ( creates double)
